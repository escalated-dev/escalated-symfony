## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] - 2026-09-12

### Added
- **Configurable database connection.** `escalated.entity_manager` names the Doctrine entity manager Escalated's own entities live on. Null uses the default manager, which is the historical behaviour and leaves an unconfigured host unchanged.

  Repositories already followed the host's mapping — `ServiceEntityRepository` resolves through `ManagerRegistry::getManagerForClass()`. The gap was everywhere else: sixty-two services in this bundle autowire `EntityManagerInterface`, which resolves the *default* manager regardless of mapping, so they would all have kept writing to the primary database silently and without error. The option is aliased to `escalated.entity_manager` and bound **by type** in the bundle's `services.yaml`, so every one of them follows the host's choice with no signature change — and a service added later cannot reach the default manager by accident.

  Your user entity is deliberately not moved: it belongs to the host and stays on whichever manager maps it.

### Added

- Central translations are now sourced from the `escalated-dev/locale`
  Composer package. The bundle prepends the package's `translations/`
  directory onto `framework.translator.paths`; the plugin-local
  `translations/` directory and any host app `translations/` continue to
  override individual keys.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-04-18

Initial tagged release.

### Added

- Full Symfony bundle: `Ticket`, `Reply`, `Department`, `Tag`, `SlaPolicy`, `AgentProfile`, `EscalationRule`, `CannedResponse`, `Macro`, `ChatSession`, `Workflow` etc. as Doctrine entities; controllers under `Customer`, `Agent`, `Admin`, `Api`, `Widget`; voters; mailers; broadcasting; saved views; SLA engine; chat routing; import service.
- Docker dev/demo environment under `docker/` (excluded from the Composer dist). `docker compose up --build` boots a Postgres-backed Symfony 7 host with the bundle registered, Doctrine migrations + fixtures, and a Twig `/demo` click-to-login picker. (#23)

### Fixed

- **Symfony 7 / Doctrine 3 compatibility** (#22):
  - `EnsureAdminVoter` / `EnsureAgentVoter` updated to match Symfony 7's `voteOnAttribute(string, mixed, TokenInterface, ?Vote $vote = null)` signature; previously crashed with `Declaration ... must be compatible with Voter::voteOnAttribute(...)`.
  - `EscalatedBundle::configure()` now declares the configuration tree via the existing `Configuration` class. Previously every `escalated:` option in user config was rejected as `Unrecognized options`.
  - `config/services.yaml` typo'd two service IDs (`EscalatedSymfonyCommandWakeSnoozedTicketsCommand`, `EscalatedSymfonySecurityKnowledgeBaseGuard`) — namespace separators stripped — failing container compilation. Fixed and added a wildcard `Escalated\Symfony\:` resource autoregistration so newly added services are picked up automatically.
- **`EnsureAgentVoter` integer PK lookup** (#25, fixes #24) — voter previously called `findOneBy(['userId' => $user->getUserIdentifier()])`, querying an `INTEGER` column with the user's email and hitting `SQLSTATE[22P02] Invalid text representation` on Postgres. Now resolves the user's PK via Doctrine metadata.
